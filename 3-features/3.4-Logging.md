# Logging System Documentation

1. Overview
   The logging system is implemented to capture and store logs for monitoring, debugging, and analysis purposes. It utilizes the Winston logging library to handle log creation, formatting, and storage. The system includes log rotation for efficient log management.

2. Architecture
   The logging system consists of the following components:

   - `logger.js`: Defines the logger configuration for application logs.

3. Logger Configuration
   The `logger.js` file configures the Winston logger for application logs:

   ```javascript
   const logger = createLogger({
     level: "info",
     format: combine(
       timestamp({ format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss" }),
       printf(({ timestamp, level, message, ...meta }) => {
         return `${timestamp} ${level}: ${message} ${JSON.stringify(meta)}`;
       })
     ),
     transports: [
       new transports.Console(),
       new DailyRotateFile({
         filename: "logs/application-%DATE%.log",
         datePattern: "YYYY-MM-DD",
         zippedArchive: true,
         maxSize: "10m",
         maxFiles: "14d",
       }),
     ],
   });
   ```

   The logger is configured with the following options:

   - `level`: Set to 'info' to log messages at the info level and above.
   - `format`: Defines the log message format using timestamps and custom formatting.
   - `transports`: Specifies the log destinations, including the console and daily rotated log files.
   - `DailyRotateFile`: Configures log rotation, with logs stored in the 'logs' directory, rotated daily, compressed, limited to 10MB per file, and retained for 14 days.

4. Log Storage and Rotation
   The logging system stores application logs in the 'logs' directory. The log files are named 'application-%DATE%.log', where %DATE% is replaced with the current date.

   Log rotation is handled by the `DailyRotateFile` transport:

   - Logs are rotated daily, with a new log file created each day.
   - Log files are compressed using gzip to save space.
   - Each log file is limited to a maximum size of 10MB.
   - Old log files are retained for a maximum of 14 days.

5. Log Levels and Usage
   The logging system supports different log levels, such as 'debug', 'info', 'warn', and 'error'. The log level can be set in the logger configuration to control the verbosity of the logs.

   To log messages in your code, you can use the logger instance:

   ```javascript
   logger.info("User created successfully", { userId: user.id });
   logger.error("Failed to create user", { error: err.message });
   ```

   The logger methods accept a message string and an optional metadata object for additional context.

6. Monitoring and Analysis
   The generated log files can be used for monitoring and analysis purposes. Application logs can be analyzed to identify errors, warnings, and critical events.

   Log management and analysis tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk can be used to centralize log collection, perform log aggregation, and provide powerful searching and visualization capabilities.

7. Best Practices

   - Use meaningful and descriptive log messages to provide context and aid in troubleshooting.
   - Include relevant metadata, such as user IDs, request IDs, or error details, to enrich log entries.
   - Set appropriate log levels based on the severity and importance of the events being logged.
   - Regularly monitor and review logs to identify issues, errors, and potential security threats.
   - Implement log retention policies to ensure compliance with legal and organizational requirements.
   - Secure log files and restrict access to authorized personnel only.

8. Future Enhancements
   - Implement log aggregation and centralized log management using tools like ELK stack or Splunk.
   - Integrate log monitoring and alerting to proactively identify and respond to critical events.
   - Implement log analysis and visualization to gain insights into system behavior and performance.
   - Enhance log formatting and structure to facilitate easier parsing and analysis.

This documentation provides an overview of the logging system implemented in your project. It covers the architecture, configuration, usage, and best practices for application logging. Feel free to further customize and expand upon this documentation based on your specific project requirements and implementation details.
