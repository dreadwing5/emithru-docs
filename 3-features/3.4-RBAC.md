# RBAC Documentation

1. Overview
   The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system is implemented to manage user permissions and access control based on roles. It allows you to define different roles (e.g., admin, faculty, student) and assign specific permissions to each role. Users are associated with roles, and their access to certain resources or actions is determined by the permissions granted to their role.

2. Architecture
   The RBAC system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

   - `Role` model: Defines the schema for the role document, including the role name and associated permissions.
   - `User` model: Defines the schema for the user document, including the user's details and the associated role.
   - `authController`: Contains the logic for user authentication and authorization, including signup, login, and role-based access control.
   - `authMiddleware`: Defines middleware functions for authenticating and authorizing users based on their roles and permissions.

3. Role Model
   The `Role` model (`Role.js`) defines the schema for the role document:

   ```javascript
   const roleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
       unique: true,
     },
     permissions: [
       {
         type: String,
       },
     ],
   });
   ```

   Each role document has a unique `name` field and an array of `permissions` associated with that role.

4. User Model
   The `User` model (`User.js`) defines the schema for the user document and includes a reference to the associated role:

   ```javascript
   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     // ...
     role: {
       type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
       ref: "Role",
     },
     // ...
   });
   ```

   The `role` field is of type `ObjectId` and references the `Role` model.

5. Authentication and Authorization
   The `authController` (`authController.js`) handles user authentication and authorization:

   - `signup`: Creates a new user with the provided details and associates a role with the user if provided. If no role is provided, the user is created without a role.
   - `login`: Authenticates the user based on the provided credentials and generates a JWT token for subsequent authenticated requests.
   - `protect`: Middleware function that verifies the JWT token and attaches the authenticated user to the request object.
   - `restrictTo`: Middleware function that checks if the user has the required role or permissions to access a specific resource or perform an action.

   Example usage of `protect` and `restrictTo` middleware:

   ```javascript
   router.get("/users", protect, restrictTo("admin"), getAllUsers);
   ```

   In this example, the `getAllUsers` route is protected by the `protect` middleware, ensuring that only authenticated users can access it. Additionally, the `restrictTo` middleware checks if the user has the 'admin' role before allowing access to the route.

6. Authorization Middleware
   The `authMiddleware` (`authMiddleware.js`) defines middleware functions for role-based authorization:

   - `authorizePermissions`: Middleware function that checks if the user has the required permissions to access a specific resource or perform an action.

   Example usage of `authorizePermissions` middleware:

   ```javascript
   router.get(
     "/users",
     protect,
     authorizePermissions("read:users"),
     getAllUsers
   );
   ```

   In this example, the `getAllUsers` route is protected by the `protect` middleware, and the `authorizePermissions` middleware checks if the user has the 'read:users' permission before allowing access to the route.

7. Seeding Roles
   To initialize the roles in the database, you can use a seeding script (`seedRoles.js`):

   ```javascript
   async function seedRoles() {
     await Role.create([
       {
         name: "admin",
         permissions: [
           "read:users",
           "create:users",
           "update:users",
           "delete:users",
         ],
       },
       {
         name: "faculty",
         permissions: ["read:users", "create:users", "update:users"],
       },
       {
         name: "student",
         permissions: ["read:users"],
       },
     ]);
   }
   ```

   This script creates three roles ('admin', 'faculty', 'student') with their respective permissions.

8. Error Handling
   The RBAC system includes error handling for unauthorized access and invalid roles:

   - If a user tries to access a protected route without authentication, an "Unauthorized" error response is sent.
   - If a user tries to access a route or perform an action without the required permissions, an "Insufficient permissions" error response is sent.
   - If an invalid role is provided during user creation or update, an "Invalid role" error response is sent.

9. Testing
   To ensure the correctness and reliability of the RBAC system, it is important to write unit tests and integration tests. Test cases should cover various scenarios, such as:

   - Successful user signup and login with different roles.
   - Attempting to access protected routes without authentication.
   - Attempting to access routes or perform actions without the required permissions.
   - Providing invalid roles during user creation or update.

   Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to write and run the tests.

10. Future Enhancements
    - Implement role hierarchies to allow inheritance of permissions from parent roles to child roles.
    - Add the ability to dynamically assign permissions to roles and update user roles.
    - Implement role-based access control at a more granular level, such as field-level or record-level access control.
