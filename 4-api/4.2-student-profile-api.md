# Student API Documentation

## Overview

The Student module is responsible for managing student-related data and operations. It includes several sections such as Profile, Academic, Admission, Placement, Attendance, and Parent Teacher Meeting (PTM). Each section has its own set of APIs and functionality.

## Architecture

The Student module follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns. It consists of the following components:

- Controllers: Handle the incoming requests, validate the data, and send the response back to the client.
- Services: Contain the business logic and interact with the repository layer to perform database operations.
- Repository: Abstracts the data access layer and provides a clean interface for interacting with the database.
- Validation: Validates the incoming request data using a validation library like Joi.
- Routes: Define the API endpoints and map them to the corresponding controller methods.

## Repository Pattern

The repository pattern is implemented to abstract the data access layer and provide a way to easily switch the underlying database without affecting the rest of the application. Each section of the Student module has its own repository file, which contains methods for interacting with the database.

Example repository file (`studentProfileRepository.js`):

```javascript
import StudentProfile from "../models/Student/Profile.js";

export const createStudentProfile = async (profileData) => {
  const studentProfile = new StudentProfile(profileData);
  return await studentProfile.save();
};

export const getStudentProfileById = async (userId) => {
  return await StudentProfile.findOne({ userId });
};

// Add more repository methods as needed
```

The repository methods are then used in the service layer to perform the required database operations.

## Validation Layer

The validation layer is responsible for validating the incoming request data using a validation library like Joi. It ensures that the data meets the required schema and constraints before processing it further.

Example validation schema (`studentProfileValidation.js`):

```javascript
import Joi from "joi";

export const studentProfileSchema = Joi.object({
  userId: Joi.string().required(),
  fullName: Joi.string().required(),
  department: Joi.string().required(),
  // Add more validation rules for each field
});
```

The validation schema is then used in the controller layer to validate the incoming request data.

## API Routes

The Student module has multiple sections, each with its own set of API routes. Here's an example of the API routes for the Profile section:

```javascript
import { Router } from "express";
import {
  createStudentProfile,
  getStudentProfileById,
} from "../../controllers/Student/studentController.js";
import { studentProfileSchema } from "../../validations/studentProfileValidation.js";

const router = Router();

router.post(
  "/profile",
  validateRequest(studentProfileSchema),
  createStudentProfile
);
router.get("/profile/:id", getStudentProfileById);

export default router;
```

The `validateRequest` middleware is used to validate the incoming request data against the specified validation schema before passing it to the controller method.

## Student Profile Section

The Student Profile section consists of the following sub-sections:

- Student Details Form
- Admission Details
- Local Guardian Form
- Parents Details
- Contact Details

Each sub-section has its own set of APIs and corresponding controller methods, service methods, and repository methods.

Example controller method for creating a student profile:

```javascript
import { createStudentProfile } from "../../services/Student/studentProfileService.js";

export const createStudentProfile = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
  const profileData = req.body;
  const savedProfile = await createStudentProfile(profileData);

  if (!savedProfile) {
    return next(new AppError("Failed to create student profile", 400));
  }

  res.status(201).json({
    status: "success",
    data: {
      studentProfile: savedProfile,
    },
  });
});
```

## Other Sections

Similar to the Student Profile section, the other sections (Academic, Admission, Placement, Attendance, PTM) will have their own set of APIs, controllers, services, and repository methods. Each section should follow the same architecture pattern and principles.

## Error Handling and Logging

Implement a centralized error handling mechanism using middleware to catch and handle errors consistently across the application. Use a logging library like Winston or Bunyan to log errors, warnings, and other relevant information for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## Testing

Write unit tests for each component (controllers, services, repositories) to ensure the correctness of the functionality. Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha and write test cases to cover various scenarios. Integration tests can be added to verify the interaction between different components and the database.
